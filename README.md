# What's On Where

## Ticketmaster API Project

This project builds Ticketmaster website application, using Ticketmaster API, which allows users to search
for events at locations of their choice.
The locations, using Google Maps API, will also be presented on Google Maps.

## User story

AS A traveller or resident of a town

I WANT to search to see the latest events in my location or location I am travelling to.

SO THAT I can attend events and have fun.



## Acceptance criteria

GIVEN that I am on the Website

WHEN entering the name of place (city) and clicking search button

THEN I want to be presented with event information (artist name), venue name, date, beginning time and postcode area.

GIVEN that I am in past entries area

WHEN clicking on any city name

THEN I want to be presented with location information of events in that area on Google Map.



The main challenge we faced, was getting used to using the fetch command and interpreting the returned
data from the API.
We overcame this by researching other websites using APIs, reading forums, looking through tutorials and practising before implementation of our own Event Search Website.
One of the other challenges we had, was working in a group for the first time, however we overcame this by using constant communication and working to support one another.
We had the opportunity to practise and refine our current HTML and CSS skills.
We hope to optimize the Event Search Website further in the future, when we have more knowledge on server side APIs, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

## Using the code

We have fully commented the JavaScript, HTML and CSS files, to explain the flow and logic of the Event Search Website, so that others can work on this and expand on it too.
We have also tried to use correct semantic structure within the HTML and CSS files, so the code can be easily followed and worked on.
